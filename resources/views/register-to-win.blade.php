        <p>
            My wife and I have been growing some of the most beautiful blooms on our property. We have allocated a ¼ acre
            just for flowers… well...and sometimes the free-range chickens who like to take over during the change of seasons!
            We have invested countless hours, online courses, in person training trips to different states and have met some
            of the finest growers in America. I personally... have also made a ton of mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Do I till or not? Do I need to buy an expensive tractor, or not? What does Lawn Fabric Do and how do I burn it?
            Where do I buy supplies that will work best where I won’t have to take out a second mortgage on my home to afford
            them?
        </p>

        <p>
            We can help you with all of this!
        </p>

        <p>
            These are just some of the many things that we will cover during our time together! If you have thought about
            starting a garden to grow flowers or food but don’t know how or feel confident how to get started, register today!
        </p>

        <p>
            I will have 2 sessions! The first session will be April 1st from 9am to 11am and the second session will be
            April 8th from 9am to 11am. Five people will be selected for each session. Once selected, you will receive an
            email invite with confirmation of your free session and the location for each session which will be in the
            Chagrin Falls, Ohio area.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a reminder, these free sessions are for people who have zero to little knowledge of gardening.
            The intention of these sessions are to help you get started. I don’t have all the answers, but do have much
            information to share. If we do not know the answers to your questions, we know the people who will! We look
            forward to learning with you!
